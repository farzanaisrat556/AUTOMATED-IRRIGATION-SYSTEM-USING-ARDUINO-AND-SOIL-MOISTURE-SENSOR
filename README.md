# Automated Irrigation System Using Arduino and Soil Moisture Sensor

## Description

This project implements an automated irrigation system designed to optimize water usage and promote healthier plant growth. Using an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a soil moisture sensor, the system monitors the soil's moisture level in real time. When the soil becomes too dry, it automatically activates a 5V DC water pump, ensuring plants receive water only when needed.

## Features

- **Automated Watering**: Waters plants automatically based on real-time soil moisture data.  
- **Water Efficiency**: Prevents over-watering and ensures efficient water consumption.  
- **Simple & Effective**: A straightforward and reliable solution using readily available components.  
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the code to adjust moisture thresholds for different plant types.

## Components Required

To build this project, you will need the following hardware:

- **Arduino Nano**  
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**  
- **12V Relay Module**  
- **5V DC Pump**  
- **Jumper Wires**  
- **9V Battery**

## Circuit Diagram

A detailed circuit diagram is available in the project's original documentation. It outlines the connections between the Arduino Nano, soil moisture sensor, relay module, and water pump, providing a visual guide for assembly.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Assembly**  
   Connect all components according to the circuit diagram.

2. **Arduino Code**  
   Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino Nano. The code reads data from the soil moisture sensor and controls the pump via the relay module.

3. **Power On**  
   Connect the 9V battery to power the system. The system will begin monitoring soil moisture and watering the plant as needed.
